## About Petek

Petek (side-note in Hebrew)  is a little snippet I made after feeling I can't find any simple side-notes application.
The main purpose of Petek is to be as fast and accessible as possible.
I recommend using a key-binding to run it.

I know it's extreamly simple. however I find it very useful and wanted to share ;)
